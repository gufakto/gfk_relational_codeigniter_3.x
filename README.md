	application/Relationgfk.php         =>   application/Relationgfk.php
	application/ssp.php              	=>   application/ssp.php
	assets/*              				=>   assets/*

In the package you will find example usage code in the Relationgfk.php comments and 
relation.modal.js comment.  The example code isn't the most beautiful code you'll ever see but
it'll show you how to use the library and it's nice and generic.
